Contents of the book '모두의 데이터분석 with python'.
The book uses commonly used libraries in python, matplotlib, numpy and pandas for data analyzation.
It taught me basic concepts of these libraries, along with the fundametal questions one should ask before starting any data analyzation related projects.
Points to highlight were:
- finding the closest population strucutured city with a given city name.
- scatter graph of Jeju Island with the usage of colorbar, which enabled to illustrate extra feature of the data.

Also, there is a file that I practiced for a class I conducted in English Academy in Japan. 
I considered what kind of data could attract children aged 7-10 and chose population census of Japan.

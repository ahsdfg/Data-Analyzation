The book "모두의 데이터분석 with Python" focuses on utilizing commonly used Python libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas for data analysis. It covers the basic concepts of these libraries and discusses fundamental questions one should consider before embarking on any data analysis projects.

Key highlights from the book include:

1. Finding the Closest Populated City: The book demonstrates how to find the closest populated city based on a given city name, using the functionalities of the aforementioned Python libraries.
2. Scatter Graph of Jeju Island: The book showcases how to create a scatter graph of Jeju Island using Matplotlib, with the usage of a colorbar. This enables the illustration of extra features of the data, providing deeper insights.

Additionally, there is a file that I practiced for Coding class based on the book. It involves analyzing population census data of Japan, with a specific focus on attracting children aged 7-10. This exercise demonstrates how to tailor data analysis projects to specific demographics and interests, in this case, children's demographic data for an English academy coding class conducted in Japan.
